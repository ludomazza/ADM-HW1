I uploaded the .py file with all the codes I wrote and the .pdf file with the screenshots of all the submissions. 
My bachelor's degree was in Management Statistics so I had no IT background. 
The last time I had used python was in the first year of my bachelor's degree, three years ago. 
Nevertheless, thanks to the help of my colleagues, I was able to do all the assigned exercises and greatly improved my python skills.
